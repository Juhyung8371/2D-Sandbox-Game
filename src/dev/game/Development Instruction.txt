Development Instruction
------------------------

This document is to remind myself how to modify the code later.

------------
To add Item
------------

1. Add texture of item in texture file, and make the BufferedImage variable in Assets class.

2. Add the new Id of the item in ItemId class.

3. Create an custom item by extending Item class (or UseableItem).

4. Go to Item class and make an variable of the new item and add it to the itemInstance array
	(order of elements doesn't matter).

5. If item is use-able check "checkUseItem" method in GameState class.

6. Check the item save and load method in GameState if needed.

7. Done.

-----------------------
To add crafting recipe
-----------------------

1. Go to AllCraftingRecipe class, make a CraftingRecipe variable.

2. Put that variable in the AllCraftingRecipe.getAllRecipes() array.

3. Done.

--------------
To add Entity
--------------

1. Make the texture of entity (if it's moving entity, it's better to make a separate image file)

2. Make the BufferedImage variable in Assets class.

3. Go to EntityId class and add new Id.

4. Create the new entity by extending Entity class (or Creature, StaticEntity, etc.)
   If it is PlaceableEntity, check checkUseItem() method in GameState class.
   If the Entity is Creature and is not going to be able to run, 
   set runnableCreature = false in constructor.

5. If other entity can walk over it, set noCollision = true. PlaceableEntity is noCollision = true by default.

6. If the entity is capable to be naturally spawned, go to EntityManager to add the feature.
   And also add the case of new entity's natural spawn in NaturalSpawn.spawn() method, if needed 
   (spawning on specific tile, extra large size entity, etc.).

7. Check the load and save of the entity in Chunk class.
   Entity with extra information or PlaceableEntity may require modification in saving and loading (fence entity).
   Look for Chunk.getChunkFromFiles(int, int, String, int)

8. Go to EntityManager.getEntityById(int, int, int) method and add the case of this new Entity.

9. Done.

-------------
To add Tile
-------------

1. Add texture of tile in texture file, and make the BufferedImage variable in Assets class.

2. Add the new Id of the tile in TileId class.

3. Create an custom tile by extending Tile class.

4. Go to Tile class and make an variable of the new tile and add it to the tileInstance array
	(order of elements doesn't matter).

5. If tile has animation, use Animation (See WaterTile for example).

6. Go to MapGenerator class and check getTileByBiome(double, double) 
   to include the new tile in the random world generation.
   Also check getRByTile(int, int) for the rate of entity spawn on the tile.
   
7. Done.
